Absolutely, my friend of the cloud and code 🌩️ — here is the full guide translated into English, for integrating Xero Partner 2.0 with a Next.js project hosted on Vercel, wrapped in clarity and a touch of poetry ✨:

⚒️ 1. ⚙️ Technical Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

A Next.js project (npx create-next-app)
A Xero Developer Account: https://developer.xero.com/myapps
A Vercel account connected to your GitHub repo
And of course… your Client ID and Client Secret from Xero
🧩 2. Install the xero-node SDK

npm install xero-node
This SDK handles OAuth 2.0, token refresh, tenant linking, and API requests. A full spellbook for Xero 🪄

📁 3. Project Structure

Create your API routes under /pages/api/auth:

/pages
  /api
    /auth
      xero.ts         ← Redirects to Xero
      callback.ts     ← Handles the OAuth callback
.env.local
🔐 4. Add your Xero variables

In your .env.local file at the root of the project:

XERO_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
XERO_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret
XERO_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-vercel-project.vercel.app/api/auth/callback
🛡 On Vercel, you'll set these in Project Settings > Environment Variables
🚀 5. Create /api/auth/xero.ts

// pages/api/auth/xero.ts
import { XeroClient } from 'xero-node'

const xero = new XeroClient({
  clientId: process.env.XERO_CLIENT_ID!,
  clientSecret: process.env.XERO_CLIENT_SECRET!,
  redirectUris: [process.env.XERO_REDIRECT_URI!],
  scopes: ['openid', 'email', 'profile', 'offline_access', 'accounting.transactions'],
})

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const url = await xero.buildConsentUrl()
  res.redirect(url)
}
🌀 6. Create /api/auth/callback.ts

// pages/api/auth/callback.ts
import { XeroClient } from 'xero-node'

const xero = new XeroClient({
  clientId: process.env.XERO_CLIENT_ID!,
  clientSecret: process.env.XERO_CLIENT_SECRET!,
  redirectUris: [process.env.XERO_REDIRECT_URI!],
  scopes: ['openid', 'email', 'profile', 'offline_access', 'accounting.transactions'],
})

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  try {
    await xero.apiCallback(req.url!)         // handles code from the callback
    await xero.updateTenants()               // fetches connected Xero orgs
    const invoices = await xero.accountingApi.getInvoices(xero.tenants[0].tenantId)

    res.status(200).json({
      message: 'Connected to Xero',
      invoices: invoices.body.invoices,
    })
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Xero OAuth failed' })
  }
}
🌍 7. Run Your Project Locally

npm run dev
Then visit:
🔗 http://localhost:3000/api/auth/xero
→ You’ll be redirected to Xero → then back to /callback with access

☁️ 8. Deploy on Vercel

Connect your project to GitHub
Go to https://vercel.com/import and import the repo
Under Project > Settings > Environment Variables, add:
XERO_CLIENT_ID=...
XERO_CLIENT_SECRET=...
XERO_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-vercel-project.vercel.app/api/auth/callback
Click Deploy
And voilà — Xero integration is live in the sky ☁️✨
🧠 Bonus: Token Persistence

The xero-node SDK handles token refreshes for you if offline_access is in the scopes. If you'd like to store the tokens in a database (MongoDB, Supabase, PostgreSQL...), I can help you wire it up.

📜 Quick Recap

Item	Purpose
🔑 Xero App	Created via developer.xero.com
🔐 Environment Vars	Stored in .env.local and on Vercel
⚗️ SDK	xero-node for OAuth + API
🧭 API Routes	/api/auth/xero and /api/auth/callback
☁️ Vercel Deployment	Serverless and automatic
Would you like next:

To listen to Xero webhooks for real-time updates?
To store and refresh tokens automatically in a database?
To display invoices and payments directly in your React dashboard?
Let me know — I’ll guide your sails across the API seas 🌊💡

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

To build and run using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t my-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
```

The containerized application can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker, including:

- AWS ECS
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure Container Apps
- Digital Ocean App Platform
- Fly.io
- Railway

### DIY Deployment

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

```
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json (or pnpm-lock.yaml, or bun.lockb)
├── build/
│   ├── client/    # Static assets
│   └── server/    # Server-side code
```

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever CSS framework you prefer.
